his is a simple python script that can calculate your calories.

The idea here is that you have easy access to some type of calculation for your calorie intake. By integrating this with a database,
you can add and edit your favorite meals or foods. It already contains some items.

I'm currently working on an upgrade to help with the calculation of larger and "asymmetrical" portions and also the front-end.

Feel free to comment and give ideas (I'm new here) :)
